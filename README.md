PROJECT 1
MOVIE GENRES PREDICTING 
Embark on the journey of crafting a machine learning model geared towards predicting the genre of a movie. Leverage innovative techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings coupled with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to achieve accurate results.

The dataset for this endeavor has been sourced from Kaggle, with the link thoughtfully provided by CodeSoft. Let's dive into the cinematic world of data!


PROJECT 2
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Embark on the mission to construct a robust model designed for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Dive into a comprehensive dataset, delving into the intricacies of credit card transactions. Experiment with cutting-edge algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or the formidable Random Forests to adeptly classify transactions into either fraudulent or legitimate categories.

The dataset selected for this task has been thoughtfully gathered from Kaggle, and CodeSoft has graciously provided the link. Let's fortify the defenses against financial malfeasance!


PROJECT 3
CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Embark on the journey of crafting a predictive model tailored for anticipating customer churn within a subscription-based service or business. Harness the power of historical customer data, unraveling the intricacies of usage behavior and customer demographics. Experiment with advanced algorithms, be it the precision of Logistic Regression, the depth of Random Forests, or the finesse of Gradient Boosting, to prognosticate and forestall churn.

The dataset carefully chosen for this endeavor has been seamlessly procured from Kaggle, thanks to the link thoughtfully provided by CodeSoft. Let's predict and preempt the ripples of customer transitions!
